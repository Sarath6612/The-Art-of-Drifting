            <h1>Prevalance</h1>
        
            One of the earliest recorded drift events outside Japan took place in 1996 at Willow Springs Raceway in Willow Springs, 
            California, hosted by the Japanese drifting magazine and organization Option. Daijiro Inada (founder of the Japanese D1 Grand Prix),
            the NHRA Funny Car drag racer Kenji Okazaki, and Keiichi Tsuchiya gave demonstrations in a Nissan 180SX that the magazine had 
            brought over from Japan. Entrants included Rhys Millen and Bryan Norris. Drifting has since exploded into a form of motorsport 
            in North America, Australia, Asia and Europe. Grassroots drifting has seen a huge increase in popularity in the 21st century, 
            which has in turn caused prices of FR cars to increase and parts become more scarce. Drifting has evolved into a competitive 
            sport where drivers compete (almost exclusively in rear-wheel-drive cars) to earn points from judges based on various factors. <br><br> 
            At the top levels of competition, the D1 Grand Prix in Japan pioneered the sport. Other events such as Drift Games Extreme 
            (formally known as the IDC â€” Irish Drift Championship) in Ireland, Formula D in the United States, Drift Allstars, 
            King of Europe, Drift Masters and the British Drift Championship in Europe, WDS in China, RDS in Russia, Formula Drift Asia 
            in the Malaysia/Singapore/Thailand/Indonesia/Philippines, NZ Drift Series in New Zealand, the Australian Drifting Grand Prix, 
            Spec - D Drift Series in Western Canada and the Greek Drift Championship (Drift Wars) have come along to further expand it 
            into a legitimate motorsport worldwide. Drivers within these series are able to keep their cars sliding for extended periods 
            of time, often linking several turns.
