            <h1>Ken Block</h1>
        
            Ken Block's rally career began in 2005. His skill and car control became quickly apparent and Block aptly nabbed 
            Rookie of the Year that season in the Rally America Championship. He's also accumulated five X Games 
            medals since the start of his career, including most recently taking silver at Global X Games Barcelona RallyCross 
            in 2013. <br>

            In addition to his performance in the car, Block has been a driving force in shedding light on the sport of 
            rally within the United States. His keen branding and marketing acumen, combined with his talents and skills 
            behind the wheel, has also allowed Block to achieve global fame as a rally driver through his wildly successful
             viral Gymkhana series of videos. With all nine of his Gymkhana videos (plus all associated edits) clocking in at 
             over 500 million views on the franchise in total, they have helped put Block in front of eyeballs around the world. 
             The franchise has also racked up several awards, including making the top 10 viral video charts by Ad Age, as well 
             as the One Show Interactive Gold Pencil Award in the category of Online Films & Video/Long Form - Single, for 
             excellence in an advertising <br>

            In January 2010, Block formed the Monster World Rally Team and signed with Ford to pursue his dreams of racing in the 
            World Rally Championship and in doing so, became one of only four Americans to ever score points in the WRC (more 
            Americans have actually landed on the moon than scored points in the WRC). Additionally, his signing with Ford 
            included campaigning domestically in racing (Global RallyCross Championship, X Games and Rally America), as well as 
            continuing with his Gymkhana driving. In 2012, Block re-named his team Hoonigan Racing Division, with the goal to 
            further push the boundaries of motorsports marketing. In 2013, 2014 and 2015, Block dedicated himself to competing in 
            the Global Rallycross Championship, finishing second overall in 2015. 2016 saw Block move to racing full-time in the
             FIA World Rallycross Championship which he did for the full 2016 and 2017 seasons.
