            <h1>Kunimitsu Takahashi</h1>
        
        Kunimitsu Takahashi (Shinjitai: 高橋 国光, Takahashi Kunimitsu, 29 January 1940 - 16 March 2022) was a Japanese professional
        motorcycle road racer, racing driver, and team manager. Nicknamed "Kuni-san", he is known as the "father of drifting".

        His racing career lasted from 1958 to 1999. He competed on motorcycles between 1958 and 1963, during which he became 
        the first Japanese rider to win a World Grand Prix, taking four world-level wins in total. Injuries sustained in a crash 
        in 1962 led to him switching to four-wheels in 1965, after which he won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in class, become a 
        four-time All-Japan Sports Prototype Champion, and won in Japanese Top Formula, JTC, and JGTC. His final victory as a 
        driver in 1999 came at the age of 59.

        His racing team, Team Kunimitsu, has won multiple championships in Super GT. He was the chairman of the GT Association, 
        the organizers of the Super GT series, from 1993 to 2007.
