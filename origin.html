            <h1>Origin</h1>
        
            Despite the popular belief that drifting originated in 1970s Japan, this driving technique was first practiced in Europe 
            before 1950. Automotive icon Enzo Ferrari credits Italian driver Tazio Nuvolari as being the inventor of the four-wheel 
            drift. Later, British racing driver Stirling Moss improved upon Nuvolari's technique, mastering the art of drifting through 
            curves in Formula 1 races by steering with the accelerator pedal. More recently, drifting as a specialized competition 
            became popular in Japan. It was most popular in the All Japan Touring Car Championship races. Famous motorcyclist turned 
            driver Kunimitsu Takahashi was the foremost creator of drifting techniques in the 1970s. <br><br>
            
            This earned him several championships and a legion of fans who enjoyed the spectacle of smoking tires. The bias-ply racing 
            tires of the 1960s–1980s lent themselves to driving styles with a high slip angle. As professional racers in Japan drove this way, 
            so did street racers.Keiichi Tsuchiya, known as the "Drift King" (ドリフトキング, Dorifuto Kingu), became particularly interested 
            in Takahashi's drift techniques. Tsuchiya began practicing his drifting skills on the mountain roads of Japan, and quickly gained a
            reputation amongst the racing crowd. In 1987, several popular car magazines and tuning garages agreed to produce a video 
            of Tsuchiya's drifting skills. The video, known as Pluspy, became a hit and inspired many of the professional drifting 
            drivers on the circuits today. In 1988, alongside Option magazine founder and chief editor Daijiro Inada, he helped to 
            organize one of the first events specifically for drifting called the Ikaten (short for Ikasu Hashiriya Team Tengoku). 
            He has also drifted through every turn in Tsukuba Circuit.
